;Byte 1 is the low eight bits of the X position. The MSB is in byte 3 (anchor sprite only).
;Byte 2 is the low eight bits of the Y position. The MSB is in optional byte 5 (anchor sprite only).
;
;Byte 3 is bitmapped:
;	4-7		Palette offset, added to each palette index from pattern before drawing
;	3		Enable X mirror
;	2		Enable Y mirror
;	1		Enable rotation
;	0		Anchor (normal) sprite: MSB of X coordinate

;Byte 4 is bitmapped:
;	7	Enable visibility
;	6	If 1, the optional 5th attribute byte should follow fourth one.
;		If 0, only four attribute bytes are expected (accidental fifth byte send to port will be treated as first byte of next sprite attributes), and all extra sprite features (not covered by 4 byte block) will be reset to zero (as if 5th byte equal to value zero was explicitly sent).
;	5-0	Pattern index ("Name")
;relative sprite: enable relative Palette offset (1 = the anchor Palette offset is added, 0 = independent Palette offset)
;
;Optional (when bit 6 is set in byte 4) byte 5 is bitmapped:
;For anchor sprites:
;	7-6	"H N6" - "H" is 4/8 bit graphics selector, "N6" is sub-pattern selector for 4 bit modes.
;		%00 = 8-bit colour patterns (256 bytes), this sprite is "anchor"
;		%01 = this sprite is "relative" (4/8-bit colour is selected by "anchor" sprite) â†’ see tables below
;		%10 = 4-bit colour pattern (128 bytes) using bytes 0..127 of pattern slot, this sprite is "anchor"
;		%11 = 4-bit colour pattern (128 bytes) using bytes 128..255 of pattern slot, this sprite is "anchor	"
;	5	Type for following relative sprites: 0 = "composite", 1 = "big sprite"
;	4-3	x-axis scale factor: %00 = 1x (16 pixels), %01 = 2x, %10 = 4x, %11 = 8x (128 pixels)
;	2-1	y-axis scale factor: %00 = 1x (16 pixels), %01 = 2x, %10 = 4x, %11 = 8x (128 pixels)
;	0	MSB of Y coordinate
