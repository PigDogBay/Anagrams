=== Overview ===

The Scholar is an anagram puzzle game played against the clock.
Lifelines are available to help you out. Each round consists of
three anagrams to solve. The anagrams are related, e.g. Carry On
Films. After each round the category changes. Complete eight
rounds to win the game. On the start screen (Prospectus) you can
select game difficulty by choosing a particular college.

=== Requirements ===

ZX Spectrum Next or emulator such as ZEsarUX. A mouse is
essential, however you can use a Kempston joystick in Port 1.

=== Controls ===

To drag a tile: left click on a letter tile, drag it, then
release to drop. Tiles will snap into slots. Buttons can be
clicked (left mouse) to activate. Hover over buttons to see a
tooltip at the bottom of the screen. To continue, click anywhere
on the background. For joystick users, fire (Gamepad B) equals
left mouse click.

=== Welcome Freshman ===

You have been accepted to the University of Oxbridge. Choose
your college, which will hopefully be your home for the next
eight years. Each year you will study one area of knowledge. The year
is divided into three terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity. A
collection (exam) is set each term which you must pass. Use
study aids to help you succeed. Freshers or first year, is general
knowledge to help settle you in. At the end of the year a new
subject will be chosen.

After completing year 8, you will become a Scholar. Good luck!

=== Prospectus ===

At the start of the game you must select your college. For
beginners, try Teddy Hall or St Easy Peaseys. Use left or right
arrow buttons to select your college.

Each college has different settings: 
* Start Time - The time you start with at the beginning of the year
* Time Deduction - Each year the start time will decrease by this amount
* Study Aids - tools to help you pass (hover to read what each does) 
* Reroll Cost - time cost to change category

Click anywhere on the background to begin your first puzzle set.
The first category is general knowledge and should be straightforward.

=== Play ===

In the middle of the screen are slots (hatched squares with a
plus symbol) and tiles (cream squares showing a letter). Drag
each tile to a slot to solve the anagram before the timer
reaches zero. When you complete an anagram you start the next
term with the time remaining. After three anagrams you pass the
year and move to the Lecture Notes screen.

Study aids on the left hand side: 
* Calculator - select a tile and a matching slot will be revealed 
* Yin and Yang - select a slot and a matching tile will be revealed 
* Beer - matches a random unslotted tile to slot 
* Notepad - provides one clue per year (all three anagrams are related)

Note each college has a different set of Study Aids.

To quit the game press the Exit icon top right.

=== Lecture Notes ===

At the end of Trinity term you begin a new year. A new category
is chosen and the timer is reset(*). On this screen you see the
current year and category.

Reroll - press to select a different category. Note that rerolls
deduct time. Click anywhere else to start the year.

After completing Year 8, you will leave your college as a Scholar.
Try to become a scholar for each college.

(*) Each year the starting time decreases by a set amount.

=== Tips ===

* Use study aids wisely. 
* For an easier game choose a college with a longer start time, eg St Easy Peaseys. 
* Use the Notepad only once per year. 
* Puzzles are related (e.g. French scientists) - use this to guess. 
* Change a category by pressing the Reroll button on the Lecture Notes screen
* Reposition letters to spot the word. 
* Each study aid has a time cost - plan carefully.
