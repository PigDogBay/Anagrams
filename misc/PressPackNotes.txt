=== Game Details ===

The Scholar was written in Z80 assembler using Sjasmplus, VS Code and Dezog.
All music and SFX was composed on NextDAW, the title music was graciously
permitted use to me by RetroSteveUK (https://bio.link/retrosteveuk)

The game took 4 months to code, albeit most of in Sept/Oct 25.
The game is free of charge (NYOP) on itch.io and will be available later
from GetIt

The game has 7 categories each with 50 sets of anagrams:
Freshers, Film and TV, Games and Tech, History, Music, Science and World
That's a total of 3x7x50 = 1050 anagrams


=== Future Plans ===

If the game proves popular I will make a Deluxe version of the game, including:
- Extra categories
- 100 anagram sets per category
- Boss level for the Trinity term, eg blank letters, double time, no life lines
- More study aids, such as skip term, group letters into words
- Extra SFX and graphical polish
